<pre><font size="2"> 														In Beatrice Prior's dystopian Chicago world, society is divided into five factions, each dedicated to the cultivation of a&nbsp;
														particular virtue—Candor (the honest), Abnegation (the selfless), Dauntless (the brave), Amity (the peaceful), and Erudite&nbsp;
														(the intelligent). On an appointed day of every year, all sixteen-year-olds must select the faction to which they will devote&nbsp;
														the rest of their lives. For Beatrice, the decision is between staying with her family and being who she really is—she can't&nbsp;
														have both. So she makes a choice that surprises everyone, including herself.&nbsp;


														During the highly competitive initiation that follows, Beatrice renames herself Tris and struggles alongside her fellow&nbsp;
														initiates to live out the choice they have made. Together they must undergo extreme physical testsof endurance and intense&nbsp;
														psychological simulations, some with devastating consequences. As initiation transforms them all, Tris must determine&nbsp;
														who her friends really are—and where, exactly, a romance with a sometimes fascinating, sometimes exasperating boy fits&nbsp;
														life she's chosen. But Tris also has a secret, one she's kept hidden from everyone because she's been warned it can mean&nbsp;
														And as she discovers unrest and growing conflict that threaten to unravel her seemingly perfect society, she also learns&nbsp;
														that her secret might help her save those she loves . . . or it might destroy her.&nbsp;
